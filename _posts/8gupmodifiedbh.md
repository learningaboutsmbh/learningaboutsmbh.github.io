In this study, researchers investigate the weak gravitational lensing effect around a black hole, specifically in the context of the GUP-corrected-Schwarzschild space time (S-GUP) and within a plasma environment. Using observational data from the EHT project for M87* and Sgr A*, the researchers constrained parameters in the S-GUP gravity model. The investigation aimed to connect with observations by examining magnification, image positions, and weak deflection angle for sources near M87* and Sgr A*

The investigation explores the application of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) to address issues in general relativity (GR). GUP’s implications, including the removal of singularities at the Planck scale, have led to extensive studies. The paper delves into the GUP-corrected black hole metrics, considering effects on accretion disks, and examining various physical phenomena. Plasma effects in the GUP- modified Schwartzschild black hole are highlighted, impacting weak gravitational lensing and shadow features. The study emphasizes the importance of testing gravity models through diverse, observational techniques, referencing recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The paper aims to investigate photon motion and weak gravitational lensing around black holes within the GUP-modified gravity model, contributing to our understanding of fundamental forces in the universe. 

This paper explores the effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle on Schwarzschild spacetime, particularly examine null geodesics, shadows, and weak gravitational lensing. The key findings include a decrease in photon orbits and the black hole shadow radius with an increasing GUP modification parameter. The GUP modification parameter also causes a reduction in the deviation angle during weak gravitational lensing. The study introduces three images (two ordinary and one relativistic) in the presence of plasma, influenced by the GUP parameter, with details on magnification provided. Plasma’s impact on photo radius, shadow, deflection angle, and magnification is analyzed, revealing variations with increasing plasma parameters for different scenarios. Overall the study sheds light on the interplay between GUP effects and plasma in the context of black hole physics.
