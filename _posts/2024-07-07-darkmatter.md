This paper explored two fundamental cosmic mysteries: black holes and dark matter. Black holes, formed from collapsing massive stars, bend space and time and have been confirmed through observations like the Event Horizon Telescope’s (EHT) images of black hole shadows in M87. Dark matter, making up about 85% of the universe’s matter, remains undetectable, with various models like WIMPs and axions proposed to explain it. Recent advancements suggest that permissive black holes could serve as laboratories for detecting dark matter’s effects. This study aims to derive new black hole solutions. 

The two dark matter models used in this study:
interpreting dark matter as a non-local effect of emergent gravity
viewing dark matter as arising from dark energy treated as a superconductor 
These models are characterized by parameters ξ and η, associated with length scales l and λG. The impact of these models on black hole properties such as the event horizon, null geodesics, and shadow was analyzed, revealing significant differences, particularly in the effects of the length scales l and λG. 

The study highlights that the EHT has confirmed the existence of black holes, though measurement uncertainties remain. Future advancements in astrunomical instruments, such as Solar System-based Very Long baseline INterferometry, may help detect parameter imprint, potentially validating one of the dark matter models The research also suggests that a large mass of dark matter fall is needed to account for the EHT measurement uncertainties. 

The study also proposes several future research directions. One of them includes exploring the effects of dark matter on hypothetical micro black holes. Another potential areas of exploration includes investigating dark matter’s impact on weak and strong deflection angles, quasi normal modes, thermodynamics, accretion disks, and wormhole geometries. This comprehensive approach aims to deepen the understanding of dark matter’s influence on black hole properties.
