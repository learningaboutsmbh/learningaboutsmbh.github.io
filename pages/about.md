Hi, I am Lauren, I am currently a year 12 student in the UK and I take Physics, Chemistry and Maths for my A-levels. Ever since my GCSEs, I have developed an interst within the stem field, especially in Physics. To explore this interest further, I have conducted research on EHT black holes and put together this website, where I have summarised articles relevant to the topic.
